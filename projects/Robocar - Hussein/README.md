I designed a Robo-Car in C. It uses an ESP32. I've tested it out in Wokwi. I designed a body for the car and motors in TinkerCAD. I got the measurements from their datasheets. I'm interested in possibly implementing video feedback with Bluetooth or over WiFi and then incorporating an auto-drive feature with detection that can safely get you from Point A to Point B without crashing.
