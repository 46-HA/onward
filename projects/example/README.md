#EXAMPLE
##This is an example project to show how you should submit your files. Here is the hierarchy of the project:

*project-name*
*├── print*
*│ └── 3D print files*
*├── src*
*│ ├── diagram.json*
*│ ├── libraries.txt*
*│ ├── (main code file)*
*│ └── wokwi-project.txt*
*└── README.md --> You are here*

You should talk about what you designed, how it works, what components you're using, etc.

*I created a spinning servo using Tinkercad, Wokwi, and a ESP32. The servo motor is connected to a breadboard. I designed and tested the circuit in Wokwi, then 3D printed a chasis in TinkerCAD. I learned how to read datasheets and coded my first ESP32 project!*
