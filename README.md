# **Onward: A WIP Arduino Robot YSWS**

## **Outline:**

Users would submit a schematic and design for a robot of their choosing. The design has to include:

- Arduino Nano/ESP32
- Motor or alternative
- 3D print files for a case (would act like a chassis)

Users can ask for custom components or use a wide list of already supported items. The list is an example of what could be available:

- Camera
- Bluetooth module
- Sensors
- Propellers
- Accelerometer/gyroscope
- Servo Motors
- Infrared sensor

Project ideas can be anything!

## **Getting Started:**

### **1. Join Hack Club Slack**
Join [here](https://hackclub.com/) and make sure to check out the **#onward** channel for more details on how to get started!

### **2. Build a robot**
Create the schematic, chassis, and code.

**It is recommended that you use Wokwi and TinkerCAD, but you can use whatever you're comfortable with**


*I've never created a circuit board before!*

Hack Club has [tutorials](https://jams.hackclub.com/tag/pcb) you can follow!

You could also view other projects aswell, [here is a Robo-Car!](projects/Robocar%20-%20Hussein/)

### **4. Recieve and Assemble**
After your PR gets approved, we will ship your components and 3D printed chasis!

### **5. Post in #onward! (optional)**

## **FAQ**
